# How is AnYme built?

AnYme is a native Android application written in Kotlin and Java using Android Studio.

# Why use AnYme?

AnYme is not a competing app. I do not maintain it for the sake of being better than other apps. That said, there are some reasons to pick AnYme over other apps. Here's just a small list:

* No Ads
* MAL integration. In fact, AnYme was the first app with MAL integration after their site was relaunched. (An Alpha download was available in less than 3 hours after the site came online)
* Alpha updates are released multiple times per week
* It has a subreddit with more than 8.1K subscribers (https://anyme.app/reddit)
* It is based off the most recent SDK build tools for best compatibility with most phones and tablets
* It has no app permissions, so it can't look at your files and send them to a server
* It has a Trello board so you can follow the development progress (https://anyme.app/todo)
* 🎉 And best of all, this is not made using Xamarin/Visual Studio! 🎉
