## Things you should know

* **The app requires no app permission**. So it can't look at your private files and send them to a server
* You need at least Android 4.4
* Minimum supported device size: 4.7". You can still run the app on smaller devices, however the layouts are not optimized.
* You can request new features on https://www.reddit.com/r/anYme
* anYme uses **HTTPS** when connecting to MAL, tho when creating a MAL account, I recommend you use a password you do not use anywhere else. This is just a general advise for all sites
